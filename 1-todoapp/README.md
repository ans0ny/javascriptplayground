# 1st project, todo list from memory

This project is pretty much a copy of [MDN's tutorial of making a shopping list.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)
But, trying to do stuff from memory and looking up documentation.

## Constraints

- No frameworks of any kind
- Look up stuff to familiarize with documentation

## The result

I did everything until the delete button part, which I copied from the tutorial.

## Things to add

- Make it look good
- Add some animation
- More functionalities, like local storage
- Getting feedback
- Good commenting to know what I am doing
