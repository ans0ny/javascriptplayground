# 1st project, todo list from memory

This project is pretty much a copy of [MDN's tutorial of making a shopping list.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)
But, trying to do stuff from memory and looking up documentation.

## Constraints

- No javascript frameworks of any kind (Some CSS styling is OK)
- Look up stuff to familiarize with documentation

## The result

I did everything until the delete button part, which I copied from the tutorial.
It is quite a simple todo app.

## Things to add

- [x] Make it look good
- [x] Add some animation
- [x] More functionalities, like local storage.
7/5 Update: I consulted MDN Docs for localStorage documentation, but ultimately asked ChatGPT to help me. [ChatGPT Link](https://chat.openai.com/share/514753e1-5bcd-4999-b39a-264b065a2de0)
- [ ] Getting feedback
- [ ] Good commenting to know what I am doing
- [x] Packaging
- [x] Deploy on internet [Netlify](https://64a66a5f07f0ef000980f5c2--euphonious-rabanadas-9df51f.netlify.app/)
- [ ] Edit button
- [ ] Add dialog when deleting items (confirm option is annoying)
- [ ] An actual checkmark to finish a task
- [ ] Drag and drop like a kanban app
