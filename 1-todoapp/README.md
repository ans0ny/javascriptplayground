# 1st project, todo list from memory

This project is pretty much a copy of [MDN's tutorial of making a shopping list.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)
But, trying to do stuff from memory and looking up documentation.

## Constraints

- No javascript frameworks of any kind (Some CSS styling is OK)
- Look up stuff to familiarize with documentation

## The result

I did everything until the delete button part, which I copied from the tutorial.

## Things to add

- [] Make it look good
- [] Add some animation
- [] More functionalities, like local storage
- [] Getting feedback
- [] Good commenting to know what I am doing
- [x] Packaging
