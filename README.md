# About this project

This project is made to train myself in Javascript mainly, but also doing some frontend related development. More of an experimental repository.

I also have a [website focused repo.](https://github.com/ans0ny/personal-web)

Actually not sure whether to merge the two, but keeping it separate for now.

1. [x] Make a todo list
2. [ ] A page with just buttons
3. [ ] Try 11ty
4. [ ] Pick a clientside framework
5. [ ] Eventually fullstack framework?
